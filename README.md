# Nuix Web Review Uninstaller
A small utility written in Python to assist with backup and uninstall for the Nuix Web Review services. 

This utility will guide the user through the process of uninstalling all of the various services, and requesting confirmation if certain directories should be backed up. This will allow you to backup group configuration, the MariaDB instance, dashboard perspectives, snapshots, etc. 

A directory will be created in the "C:\Program Files\Nuix\Web Platform" directory named "WRA Backup \<Timestamp\>".
